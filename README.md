• A point cloud is a set of data points in some coordinate system. In a three dimensional coordinate system, these points are usually defined by X, Y, and Z coordinates, and often are intended to represent the external surface of an object. 

• In this project, an algorithm is developed to automatically locate, segment and classify small objects (in this case, pole) in 3D scan of urban environment. 

• Object detection in point cloud is popular in HD Map and Sensor-Based autonomous driving. There are basically four types of object which can be obtained from daily scenarios like: lane, guardrail, pole, road surface etc.
